### Version 1

```{r}
hours_data <- data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(.groups = 'keep',
    mht = mean(hours_total, na.rm=T),
    mhr = mean(hours_est, na.rm=T), 
    mhc = mean(hours_teach, na.rm=T))
hours_data$country <- fct_reorder(hours_data$country, hours_data$mht)
hours_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = country, y = mht)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

This is the first version of the figure, it lacks color and nuance so isn't useful for telling the story. 


### Version 2

```{r}
hours_data %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(x = country, y = mht), stat = "identity", fill = "RED") +
  geom_bar(aes(x = country, y = mhr), stat = "identity", fill = "BLUE") +
  geom_bar(aes(x = country, y = mhc), stat = "identity", fill = "GREEN") +
  coord_flip() +
  ggthemes::theme_fivethirtyeight()
```

Adding color definitely helped clarify the differences between each of these measures of teacher workload, but it isn't colorblind friendly, nor is it as nice as it can be.

Sidebar {.sidebar}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
|   Key to the importance of these data are the large differences between teacher responses to each of the prompts. As a stark example: In the USA, teachers report working an average (mean) of 28.9 hours teaching in the classroom each week. This estimate increases to 46.6 hours when teachers are asked to estimate their total number of job-related hours. This number jumps to 63.3 hours when weekly hours are calculated in the specific estimate prompt (summing reported hours from the 12-item list). *Country Data* (featured in the table above above) reports each measurement method's outcome by country, arranged from fewest to most total hours worked per week.  
    
|   Weekly workload of an internationally representative sample of teachers. Each teacher was asked to report the number of hours they worked during the last week using three separate prompts:  
  
  
**Teaching Hours: ** *How many 60-minute hours did you spend on teaching at this school during your most recent complete calendar week?*  
  
**Estimated Working Hours ** *During your most recent complete calendar week, approximately how many 60-minute hours did you spend in total on tasks related to your job at this school?*
  
**Total Working Hours ** *Approximately how many 60-minute hours did you spend on the following 11 tasks during your most recent complete calendar week, in your job at this school?*

### Final Version

```{r}
fig2data <- data %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(.groups = "keep",
            rag = mean(g_regret, na.rm = T),
            salary = mean(salary, na.rm = T))

world <- map_data("world")
world$country <- factor(world$region)
fig2data <- full_join(world, fig2data, by = "country")

fig2data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=rag)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "plasma") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "How much do teachers regret becoming teachers?",
       fill = "Regret") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

```

> This figure describes the amount of regret teachers feel about choosing to pursue teaching as their primary career. Interestingly, the data are truncated such that the majority of our values fall between 1.4 and 1.8. It is important to note this, as the scale was a 1-5 scale, so while there appears to be diversity in the globe, it actually is due to a limited range in our data. I added the viridis plasma continuous fill to offer increased contrast in the color.

### Version 1

```{r}
fig2dat <- fig2data %>% 
  na.omit(.) %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarise(.groups = 'keep',
            mean = mean(rag, na.rm = T))
  
ggplot(fig2dat) +
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = country, y = mean)) +
  coord_flip()
```


> The first version of this figure worked well in that it mapped the correct data on the correct country, but was unsuccessful in being particularly enjoyable to read, or having any useful inferences.


### Version 2

```{r}
fig2data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group, fill=rag)) +
  geom_polygon(colour = "white") +
  theme_void() +
  labs(title = "How much do teachers regret becoming teachers?",
       fill = "Regret") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

```


> In version two, I made several key adjustments to the plot, adding color and applying to a map friendly and moving th legend to the bottom of the figure to maximize space.

> Salary changes as documented by the department of labor statistics, documenting the changes in teacher salary between 1999 and 2016. All salary estimates were adjusted for inflation (i.e. all were put in 2016 dollars). One limitation of this visualization as it currently stands is that it lacks nuance for cost of living.

> This is another really rough version of the plot. I like that it's showing change over time, but the color breakdown is totally unusable!
