#J Comments:
# - The line at 40 hours is a really nice touch.
# - Colors and theming in general are really nice and I appreciate your description and the table. Context is very clear.

# - One really minimal aesthetic thing:
# - Consider removing the space on the y-axis between country names and bars using scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) 
# (I believe it'll be x rather than y as you used coord_flip())

### International Teacher Hourly Workload

![](fig1.gif)

### Description
|   Key to the importance of this data are the large differences between teacher responses to each of the prompts. As a stark example: In the USA, teachers report working an average (mean) of 28.9 hours teaching in the classroom each week. This estimate increases to 46.6 hours when teachers are asked to estimate their total number of job-related hours. This number jumps to 63.3 hours when weekly hours are calculated in the specific estimate prompt (summing reported hours from the 12-item list). *Table 1* (featured below) reports each measurement method's outcome by country, arranged from fewest to most total hours worked per week.
|   Weekly workload of an internationally representative sample of teachers. Each teacher was asked to report the number of hours they worked during the last week using three separate prompts:  

***Hours in Classroom: ** *How many 60-minute hours did you spend on teaching at this school during your most recent complete calendar week?*  

***General Estimate: ** *During your most recent complete calendar week, approximately how many 60-minute hours did you spend in total on tasks related to your job at this school?*   

***Specific Estimate: ** *Approximately how many 60-minute hours did you spend on the following tasks during your most recent complete calendar week, in your job at this school?*   
  + How many 60-minute hours did you spend on teaching at this school during your most recent complete calendar week?  
  + Individual planning or preparation of lessons either at school or out of school  
  + Team work and dialogue with colleagues within this school  
  + Marking/correcting of student work  
  + Counseling students (including student supervision, mentoring, virtual counselling, career guidance and behaviour guidance)  
  + Participation in school management  
  + General administrative work (including communication, paperwork and other clerical duties)  
  + Professional development activities  
  + Communication and co-operation with parents or guardians  
  + Engaging in extracurricular activities (e.g. sports and cultural activities after school)  
  + Other work tasks

  labs(title = "How much do teachers regret becoming teachers?",
       fill = "Regret") +
  theme(legend.position="bottom")

#J Comments:
# - I like the use of the plasma scale.
# - I also like the use of a map to present this information. It's really interesting to see how this differs globally.

# Minor aesthetic things:
# - If the actual score (1.4-1.8) is not essential for the audience, consider changing the legend to "Low Regret - High Regret" e.g.
# - Are the gray areas missing data? An annotation explaining that would be nice!
```

### Description
How much do teachers regret becoming teachers?
Higher scores reflect more regret.

#J Comments:
# - I like the use of animation for this plot, and the timing of transitions specifically works really well.
# - I'm a little confused by the legend--it says "Change (Percentage)" but then seems to show annual salary? That might need a relabel and some commas/dollar signs.
# - Really nice that the salary values were adjusted for inflation.

# Great job!
```

### Description
Salary changes as documented by the department of labor statistics, documenting the changes in teacher salary between 1999 and 2016. All salary estimates were adjusted for inflation (i.e. all were put in 2016 dollars)
